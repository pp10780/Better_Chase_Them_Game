To compile:

 - Run 'make' on the root directory

To execute:
 - To maximize the player's experience it is recommended that the terminal where the user will play the game is full-screened
 - Open at least 2 distinct terminals in the 'bin' directory -> "cd bin"
 - Run the server by running -> "./server {IP_ADDRESS} {PORT} {N_BOTS}"
 - Play the game by running -> "./client {IP_ADDRESS} {PORT}"
   - Initially the program will prompt you to choose a letter and the game will only start when you choose a valid letter that no one else playing the game is using.
   - Play the game and have fun!
